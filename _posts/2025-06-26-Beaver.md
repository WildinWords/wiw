Along Beaver Lake in Vancouver’s Stanley Park, the still morning air is broken by a sudden slap! No cryptids here—just a beaver warning others with its powerful tail. With saw-like teeth and shovel-shaped tails, these chubby mammals are quietly reshaping Canada’s freshwater landscapes, one log at a time.

### 🏗 Nature’s Tiny Engineers

Beavers are one of the few animals that purposefully reshape their environment. They build dams out of logs, mud, and stones to create calm ponds where they can build cozy homes called lodges.

Their record-breaking dam in Wood Buffalo National Park, Alberta, stretches almost 800 metres—longer than 7 football fields and visible from space. No concrete mixers. Just teeth.

### 🌿 Wetland Wizards

Beavers don’t just build—they transform ecosystems. Their ponds and wetlands provides safe spots for frogs to breed, fish to grow, birds to feed, and native plants to thrive. Their dams also filter water, recharge groundwater, and hold moisture during wildfires.

But sometimes, beavers flood roads, chew on prized trees, or “remodel” local landscapes. Like any engineer, their work gets mixed reviews.

### 🥬 Strict Vegetarian

Despite their lumberjack lifestyle, beavers are 100% vegetarian. No fish dinners here—just bark, twigs, leaves, roots, and aquatic plants.

In winter, they stash food underwater near their lodges, creating a personal salad bar beneath the ice. Their plant-based diet actually benefits aquatic life too, making streams cleaner and cooler for fish. 

### 🧡 What’s With Those Orange Teeth?

A beaver’s front teeth never stop growing. Their orange teeth come from iron, which makes them super strong. Their teeth are perfectly designed for cutting trees—hard on the outside, softer inside—like natural wood-chiseling tools.

A single beaver might fell 200 trees a year, mostly softwoods like willow and aspen, using its bite and determination alone.

### 🍪 More Than A Tail

The beaver’s paddle-shaped tail acts like a Swiss army knife: a rudder in water, a fat reserve for winter, a warning drum, and even a pillow.

And it once starred on dinner tables. In medieval Europe, Catholic monks classified beaver tails as “fish” because of their scaly look (actually a depression in the skin) and aquatic feature—so it was fair game during Lent. In Quebec, that legacy inspired the delicious (non-beaver) dessert: *BeaverTails*—flat, sweet, and purely pastry. 

### 💰 From Pelts to National Symbol

Before the 1600s, beavers were mainly hunted for their *tails* (for Lent feasts) and *castoreum* (a musky, vanilla-scented oil from scent glands near their groin). Castoreum was highly valued in perfumes, incense, and medicine. But by the late 16th century, the real prize became the beaver’s fur. With coarse outer guard hairs and ultra-soft underfur that insulates in icy water, beaver pelts became the soft gold standard for European hat-making.

This demand launched the North American fur trade, sparking colonial expansion, shaping Indigenous trade routes, and nearly driving beavers nearly extinct—from over 60 million to fewer than 100,000 by 1900. The Hudson’s Bay Company profited massively, even featuring a beaver on its coat of arms. In an ironic turn, the same company later supported protect beavers. And in 1937, the beaver was declared Canada’s national animal. Today, this iconic builder appears on the nickel—a quiet nod to its historic role in building the country.

### 🌱 Let Beavers Be

Thanks to conservation, beavers are returning. Their wetlands are reviving ecosystems and supporting wildlife from frogs to otters.

If you spot a chewed tree stump or a lodge on your walk, smile, you’re witnessing nature’s finest architect at work. Enjoy it from a distance. And if their work floods your backyard or damage the property, contact to wildlife professionals instead of removing dams directly.

Let’s learn to share the stream with them!
