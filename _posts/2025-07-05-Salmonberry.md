Wander through Vancouver’s coastal rainforests in late spring, and you might hear a Swainson’s thrush singing its magical tune—“xwexwelexwelexwelexwesh!” Known as the Salmonberry Bird to many Indigenous communities, its call is said to help berries into ripening. Across Haida, Tlingit, and Coast Salish stories, this bird and the first juicy salmonberries are ancient allies, bringing the forest’s sweet summer treasure to life in hues of ruby red and golden orange.

### 🍓What’s in a Name?

Despite the name, salmonberries *don’t taste like salmon*. The name likely comes from their glowing salmon-colored skin—or from traditional pairings of the berries with salmon and fish roe in Indigenous dishes. Even more poetic: they ripen just as salmon return to spawn, reminding us of nature’s rhythms, where berry and fish feed land, people, and wildlife alike.

### 🦋Butterfly Leaf & Garden Stars

Salmonberry’s trifoliate leaves hide a secret: fold the top leaflet down, it turns into a leafy butterfly! Its bright pink flowers are among the earliest signs of spring, making it a favourite in gardens and urban parks alike.

### 🎨Wild Colours, Wilder Strategy

Salmonberries show off in shades from *fire-orange* to *deep red. But don’t assume red means ripe and its color doesn’t predict taste! Red ones can be tart, gold ones can be sweet, or vice versa. This genetic mix attracts a variety of wildlife and ensures the seeds get spread (also called ”dispersal”) far and wide. Whether you’re a forager or a curious hiker, it’s nature’s version of mystery flavor gummies—pick and see what you get!*

### 🔮 Not Just a Berry: Culture, Medicine, & Memory

Salmonberries are deeply rooted in Indigenous culture. Nations like the *Squamish* and *Nuu-chah-nulth* harvest not just the berries, but the spring shoots—eaten raw, steamed, or with fish. The berries are often enjoyed with herring oil, while the leaves and bark are traditional medicines of *Quinault* used for everything from burns to childbirth support. Every part of this plant carries knowledge passed down over generations.

### 🐻Forest Buffet: Everyone Wants a Bite

From *bears* to *birds, **chipmunks* to *deer, salmonberries are summer’s open snack bar. Birds like American robins and gray catbirds gobble them up and help plant new patches through their droppings. Even insects join the feast, pollinating the flowers, while the plant’s **thickets provide shelter* for little critters like salmonberry bugs. This plant isn’t just food—it’s real estate!

### 🌲Share with Wildlife

Salmonberries thrive along moist and wild *coastal forest edges, acting as a sign of a healthy coastal ecosystem. But with natural areas shrink and climate shifts, their season shortens. If you're foraging, follow the golden rule: **take only what you need (suggested no more than 1/3 of a patch), and leave the rest for the forest’s other diners*. Pick only from clean, remote areas, and always test for allergies with care.

Enjoy them, but share them. Let the forest feast, too.
