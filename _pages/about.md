### About Wild in Words

Wild in Words is a digital blog series aims to bridge public art and environmental education by making biodiversity learning easy, engaging, and meaningful. By spotlighting species in both marine and terrestrial ecosystems, Wild in Words encourages readers to care more deeply and act more boldly in support of conservation. It also connects audiences with further resources, including conservation groups, Indigenous knowledge, and citizen science initiatives.

### Our Mission

To spark wonder for the natural world by:

✅ **Bridging Urban Life & Wildlife:** Bringing species to life through fun, accessible, and factual short stories

✅ **Lasting Educational Materials:** Creating narratives for educators and nature lovers

✅ **Inspiring Action:** Turning "I never knew!" into "How can I help?"
